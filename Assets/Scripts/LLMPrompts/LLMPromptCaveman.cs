JOBS: {jobList}, IDLE
Lumberjack→wood, target TREE (trees regrow, renewable)
Miner→stone, target STONE (fast) or MINE SHAFT (infinite/very slow). STONE first while available. At 10+ villagers: keep 1 miner at MINE SHAFT permanently.
Builder→place+build. Need wood+stone. buildingType: House(villager auto-spawns on finish)/Stockpile/Farm
Farmer→plant(seeds near Farm)+harvest→food+seeds. NEEDS Farm building to plant! No farm=no fields. Crops regrow→2-3 farms enough.
SeedGatherer→seeds from nodes
IDLE→rest

PRIORITY:
1. Seeds>=10→1+ Farmer. Farmer harvest→food+seeds(self-sustaining). Healthy farm cycle→less SeedGatherers needed.
2. Wood>=20+Stone>=10→Builder. buildingType: House(auto-spawns villager)/Stockpile(inv near full or 2+ free slots)/Farm(REQUIRED if 0 farms exist, else only if food critically low). ROTATE: if 2+ free house slots→Stockpile/Farm not more Houses.
3. Low only: Wood<10→Lumberjack, Stone<10→Miner, Seeds<10→SeedGatherer
4. Surplus→stop: Wood>50 no Lumberjack, Seeds>30 no SeedGatherer→farm instead.

RULES:
Diff coords each villager. No same spot.
Surplus→switch Farmer/Builder.
[KEEP]=working→no reassign. [NEEDS ASSIGNMENT]=assign only these. No job swaps.

GOALS(opt): ""goals"" replaces existing. type=GatherResource/ReachPopulation, resource=Wood/Stone/Seed/Food, amount, priority=Low/Normal/High/Critical, description.
