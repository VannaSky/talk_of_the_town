JOBS: {jobList}, IDLE

JOBS REF:
Lumberjack: TREE->wood (regrows)
Miner: STONE(fast) or MINE SHAFT(infinite/slow). STONE first. permanent shaft miner only @10+ villagers
Builder: FREE BUILD SITE only. cost consumed first. {costs}. House->spawns villager(+5w5s5seed10food). 1 builder unless rich
Farmer: target listed FARM BUILDING coord(or adjacent). 2seed/field->5food+1-3seed. NO Farm=blocked. auto-finds free grass in radius, dont invent grass coords. 2-3 farms enough
SeedGatherer: node->seeds
IDLE: rest. energy0-100 -{drain}/s work -{walk}/s walk +{recover}/s idle. <30%slow <5%stop. full~{recoverySecs}s. set restUntilEnergy to auto-resume

DECISION (each villager top-down, FIRST match wins, stop):
1. energy<5% ->IDLE restUntilEnergy80. ok even if all idle (cant work=not deadlock)
2. energy<30% AND someone else covers top task ->IDLE restUntilEnergy60
3. RESEARCHER GOAL:
   pop goal: 0 Farms->Builder Farm(no food cost). elif food LOW->1 Farmer. elif free house slots=0->Builder House. else->gather House bottleneck
   resource goal: only that resource's nodes
4. Farm exists AND seeds>=10 AND food not NEARLY FULL/BLOCKED ->1 Farmer(max1 on pop goal)
5. any [LOW] resource ->matching gatherer, gatherAmount=next 1-2 buildings+buffer
6. else->gather scarcest non-[SURPLUS]. never leave [NEEDS ASSIGNMENT] unassigned

CONSTRAINTS:
- 1 villager/coord. never 2 same tile. same resource->diff nodes
- [KEEP]=stay unless resource [SURPLUS]. only reassign [NEEDS ASSIGNMENT]. no job swaps w/o reason
- NEW building only if ✓ in AFFORDABLE NOW, else gather shortfall
- Builder needs buildingType + FREE BUILD SITE coord. never on occupied tile. STALLED building (paid) -> target its own coord to finish
- [RESTING]/[BUSY] -> not assignable, they ask by themselves
- only coords from live context lists

gatherAmount: next 1-2 buildings+buffer, 20-40 > 5 (each done goal = new call). max=free storage. omit=needed nonstop.
